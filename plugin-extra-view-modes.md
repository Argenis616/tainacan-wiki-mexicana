# Plugin: Extra View Modes

This plugin adds 8 extra view mode options to the list of view modes available on your Collection settings.

## Introduction

By default, every Tainacan collection can show the item's list with seven view modes:

- Table
- Cards
- Records
- Masonry
- Thumbnails (if the Tainacan theme is used)
- List
- Slideshow

Most of them are available on the admin list view as well. This plugin installs extra view modes that will be visible on the theme side of the installation (the website itself) and that do not follow Tainacan's default design guidelines. It was created in the early days of Tainacan development to demonstrate the possibility of this kind of customization and serves as a good first step for any developer who wants to learn [how to create your custom view mode](/dev/extra-view-modes). We also cover this possibility - of using new view modes - [on this post](https://tainacan.org/blog/2018/06/13/custom-view-modes-how-will-the-world-see-your-collection/) in our official page.

The new view modes available are:

1. **Gallery** - A masonry view mode that displays two metadata and opens a slider lightbox.
2. **Mosaic** - A simple and marginless mosaic of item thumbnails.
3. **Frame** - A centered aligned, framed thumbnails view, like gallery expositions.
4. **Exhibition** - A framed record view, where image and metadata are expanded on hover.
5. **Albums** - Thumbnails displayed as album covers with a disk inside.
6. **Document** - Records with stacked papers style, for displaying published research.
7. **Books** - A book cover view, made for library visualizations.
8. **Polaroid** - A framed picture view, similar to polaroid photographs.
