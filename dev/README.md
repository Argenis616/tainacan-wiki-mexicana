# Tainacan for Developers

As you know, Tainacan is a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) plugin and is built on the top of this very well known platform. If you know *WordPress* it will be very easy for you to understand how Tainacan is organized, how it interacts with the database and how to build your own features on the top of it.

## Well, but I'm new to WordPress

If you don't have experience with WordPress and would like to develop a plugin for Tainacan, or to contribute to the Tainacan plugin, it's a good idea to learn some *WordPress* fundamentals. Those will be useful to everything you will deal with while working with Tainacan.

This is a non-exhaustive list of the most important topics you should look into:

* [WP_Query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query ':ignore') class - This is the heart of WordPress, the class that gives you the interface fo query for posts in the database. All interaction with the database in Tainacan uses this class.
* [Custom Post types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types ':ignore') and [taxonomies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies ':ignore') - All Tainacan entities, such as collections, metadata, filters and items, are WordPress Custom post types. To understand how WordPress handles custom post types and custom taxonomies is very helpful.
* [The Loop](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop ':ignore') - One of the main WordPress elements used to interact through posts. Useful specially if you are tweaking with themes.
* [Template Tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags ':ignore') - Simple functions used by theme developers to display dynamic content. Usually these function are used inside "The Loop" and Tainacan implements [it's own Template tags](https://github.com/tainacan/tainacan/blob/develop/src/classes/theme-helper/template-tags.php ':ignore').
* [Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/ ':ignore') - Crucial if working with themes.
* Custom queries and loops - Based on the topics above, it is good to understand how to build custom queries and loops to list posts.
